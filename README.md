# Data-Structures-Implementation 

These are my implementations of data structures in Java from scratch. This is an ongoing project, so there is always more to come. I started it April 28th, 2020. 

Up to date implemented data structures:
* *__LinkedList__*: This is a basic data structure with a root node and every node has a pointer to the next node in the list. I implemented a simple one with only a reference to the root node. However there are better more optimized ways of storing and using a linked list. More info in the first few lines of the *BasicLinkedList.java* file in the *dataStructures.linkedLists* package. 

What is to come next?
* Doubly Linked Lists
* ArrayLists or Vectors
* Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
* Stacks, Queues and Deques
* HashTables and HashSets
* Graphs
* Tries

Every sub-package has a tester class where I test every functions and feature of the data structures. Those classes are very messy. However, they are not meant to be neat, they are just for testing purposes.

More in depth explanations on my website shortly after every implementation. And perhaps even a YouTube video if it's really important to make one.
